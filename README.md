# üß† Processor Recommendation Engine (Original Monolithic App)

This repository contains the **original, monolithic version** of the Processor Recommendation & Analysis Engine. It is a complete, standalone Flask application that handles data processing, model inference, and HTML frontend rendering in a single codebase.

### ‚ú® Project Evolution: Now a Full-Stack Application!

This project was successfully evolved into a modern, decoupled, full-stack application with a separate, interactive React frontend and a containerized Python backend API.

## Key Achievements (of this Original Version)

*   **Custom-Trained ML Models (92.7% Accuracy):** Engineered the complete pipeline from data cleaning and feature engineering to training and hyperparameter tuning a multi-class classification model, lifting final performance by **2.6%**.
*   **Data-Driven Feature Creation:** Engineered **9 new, structured features** from raw, unstructured text fields, which were critical for the ML models' success.
*   **End-to-End Monolithic Deployment:** Architected and deployed a modular Flask application serving **2 distinct ML models**, fully containerized with Docker for reproducible deployment on Render.
*   **Robust Data Handling:** Successfully processed and analyzed a real-world dataset of over **1,000 unique processors**.

## The ML Pipeline & Technical Deep Dive

This project was more than just training a model; it was about building a reliable system. The process involved:

### 1. Data Processing & Feature Engineering
A key challenge was handling inconsistent string formats. I wrote functions to parse numeric values and boolean flags from text fields using regex and string manipulation in Pandas. I also engineered new, more useful features (like `has_5g`) from unstructured text columns.

### 2. Model Training & Selection
The task was framed as two distinct ML problems: a **multi-class classification** problem for the processor's function and a **multi-label classification** problem for its wireless capabilities. The entire process, including model selection (`RandomForestClassifier`) and hyperparameter tuning, is documented in the `notebooks/` directory.

### 3. Deployment & MLOps
The monolithic application was containerized using **Docker** and deployed with a **Gunicorn** production server. Performance was optimized for resource-constrained environments using Gunicorn's `--preload` flag to share model memory between workers.
